# stupidbrowser

My entry for [Boston Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](https://bostonstupidhackathon.com) 2020 edition. A MacOS web browser that procrastinates and really doesn't open up the site you want to go to. Also has a non-functional 'back' button.

## How to run

At the moment this is an Xcode project. Open up 'webtest2.xcodeproj' and hit run.

## Demo

I have a screen recording in the file stupid_browser2.mov
